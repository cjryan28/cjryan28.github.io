				<h3><b>Web Development Inaguration </b> </h3>
				<p>
					I'm marking this post as the beginning of my index page. My index page's activity before this, placing links, hardly counts as developing a blog. 
				</p>
				<br></br>
				<p>	
					I thought it would be appropriate to name my blog Journeying. It's clear that DBC will be a journey. From having experienced the first two weeks, I can tell the journey will be wide. I hesitate to call it long, because I don't think that's fair. Long makes me think of something tough, something I don't want to do or something I have to do. I think wide is better, because that's the way I feel my understanding and skills are changing. My ideas about programming are more wide now than they were two weeks ago. A lot of people say that they've come a long way after they accomplish something. After DBC, I want to look back and say <i> my ideas about programming really were narrow </i>. 
				</p>
				<br></br>
				<p>
					I thought it'd be neat to call my blog Journeying, because I want to make sure that I'm not only results oriented during the experience. DBC is structured intensively, so I can imagine it'd be easy for me to focus on what needs to be done instead of making the most of what's in front of me. I want to enjoy the journey!
				</p>

				<p>
					On a final note, the blog is set up to include content, whatever that may be. It may have random quotes, pictures, links, or other resources. I probably won't explain them, but hopefully you can either relate or understand my posting in context.
