					<h1> Peer Programming </h1>
					<div id= "body">
						<span id= "date"><i>June 15, 2014</i> </span>
						<h3> A lot to manage </h3>
						<p> 
							Peer pairing is not a simple task. Solving difficult problems with someone you've just met on platforms new to the pair takes focus. The setup requires active participation, listening, and thinking. It's easy to get distracted, moving challenges in the wrong direction, moving challenges in a different direction than my pair, or moving nowhere with challenges. It's good to be concious of how I'm experiencing a challenge so that I can communicate clearly and concisely. Sometimes, though, it's too late, and I act overwhelmed, frustrated, or bossy before I realize it's how I'm feeling. 
						</p>
						<p>
							I think the one emotion most notable that arises is low confidence. I've paired with about 10 different people, all of whom have varying skill levels and knowledge. I think when I approach a challenge, after meeting my pair- normally for the first time- I'll try to gauge who has more experience on a subject. I'm quick to play down how much I understand or know, because I like to feel very comfortable with material before I tell other's I know it. Most of the time, I assess the situation OK and we drive and naviagate in a beneficial manner to both of us. However, when I end up being the more experience pair but my assessment led me to drive, the session becomes more awkward, frustrating, and less efficient. If I'm navigating, but I end up being the less experienced pair, the session is a blow to my confidence. I think it's more important for me to learn to be fluid with transitions from one pairing responsibility to the next, or at least become more comfortable with voicing my feelings.
						</p>
						<h3> K.A.S. </h3>
						<p>  
							DBC's feedback system is really great. I'd venture to say it's one of the best developed systems in the program, and I appreciate it a lot. Kind, actionable, and specific feedback normally involves some kind of comprehensive recap of the pairing session. My feedback- which has scored OK- starts with why my I benefitted from having paired with whomever during the session. Then it explains what I think would have made the session better. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Often when I write feedback, I feel there is a tradeoff between being actionable and kind. When I want to be direct, I can come across as blunt or crude. When I am too kind, my feedback loses value, because it becomes too vague as to not hurt my pairs feelings. Luckily, DBC requires feedback also be specific, which I have found to help turn actionable feedback into kind feedback too. Specific feedback helps me do this, because specific feedback explains reasons for you to have actionable feedback. When feedback is specific, it can be seen as rational and more eye-opening and less opinionated. 
						</p>
						<h3> Meta emotions </h3>
						<p>  
							With peer pairing and feedback, I remind myself that if something isn't perfect, it doesn't mean it's wrong or that I'm not trying my hardest. Sometimes I confuse criticism with failure, and I'm working on reseting the way I think about that. Room for improvements or weaknesses are good, because they can be things I work on and progress towards. Criticism is great cause it can draw attention to things I need to work on, but it also makes me feel vulnerable. It's amazing that feedback can put a smile or make me feel like I've got a lot of work to do. I think it's good that I'm aware of how it affects me. And while I want to take feedback seriously and notice trends in the feedback I recieve, I also want to realize that it's meant in only the most supportive way.

						<h3> Tech Industry Issues </h3>
						<p> 
							I think tech companies have to think a lot about privacy. 
						</p> 
						
						<p> 
							Common technology, until recently, hadn't the capability to impact privacy. Today's society's privacy is challenged by location based services, information shared on the internet, and surveillance. Historically speaking, human lives have been more private than not, with each human deciding the information he or she wants to share and with whom he or she wants to share it. Nowadays, people, corporations, and countries have the capability to search for public information and find information some may have thought to be private. Today, tech companies are at the forefront of asking the question: is privacy a need, and if it is, how much do humans need? Tech companies are asking these questions, because they are incentivized to compromise privacy and sell personal information. 
						</p>
						
						<p> 
							Save the human need for it, privacy is an issue worth exploring, because sometimes a lack of privacy engenders security concerns. When information is made public, it can be used in a way that harms others. Deciding what information harms others is another tricky issue facing the tech industry and tech heavy organizations. This issue was most notably demonstrated by Edward Snowden and his National Security Agency document leaks. 
						</p>

						<p>
							These big questions surround an issue on which most everyone has an opinion. To explore privacy further, I have posted three relevant TED talks. The first is Edward Snowden explaining what he did and why he did it. The second is a NSA spokesperson sharing the NSA's point of view on Snowden's actions. The last talk is lighter, but equally important. In the last video, Twitter's Del Harvey explains how she accomplishes her job keeping Twitter a safe place.

					<h1> Thinking Style </h1>
					<div id= "body">
						<span id= "date"><i>June 1, 2014</i> </span>
						<h3> Thinking Style </h3>
						<p> 
							My thinking style is Abstract Sequential. 
						</p> 
						
						<p> 
							The website says that Abstract Sequential thinkers enjoy the world of theory. I feel that's pretty faithful to the way I picture my thinking style. I know that I like to read  lot of resources until I understand something. I also know I don't like to continue with something until I feel like I know exactly what's going on. I'm big with asking why.
						</p>
						
						<p> 
							So far DBC's teaching style has been manageable. With my thinking style, I normally like to take time and process information. It's nice that DBC's efficient with their teaching, posting links to resources DBC feels will most quickly and clearly explain things. Normally, I feel I can comprehend what's happening. I do have issues sometimes, and that's when my thinking style imipeads more than it helps. When I don't understand what's happening, I can take some time exploring and reading myself. This is especially counter productive when the things I am researching are topics DBC is planning to teach on later in the curriculum. 
						</p>
						
						<p> 
							I think my thinking style assimilates well with a growth mindset. I always feel that I can improve my knowledge and keep a list of topics in a notebook that I remind myself to look over again so that I can really solidify my understanding. 
						</p>

						<h3> DBC Reaction </h3>
						<p> 
							I'm going to try to be mindful here and see what happens. 
						</p> 
						
						<p> 
							Overall, I'm generally unsure. I'm unsure of the time commitment, the financial commitment, the teachers, the other students, and whether I should disable Google community notifications to my email. I'm glad Shereef explained his restaurant or kitchen analogy, from which I gathered if I continue to evaluate whether or not DBC is worth it, I'll have missed opportunities to make it worth it. Continuing, I liked that admitted DBC is an experiment. It makes me feel less unsure knowing we're all experimenting
						</p>
						
						<p> 
							Then, I have other feelings about DBC's teaching approach. These feelings are positive. I feel cool cloning repositories and having resources all around me. It's already clear that I have a support system that wants me to do my best. And I'm all for it! 
						</p>
						<p> 
							I think my residual feelings concern my learning approach. When I have a task to complete, I want to do it efficiently, completely, and correctly. 
						</p>
						
						<p>
							First I look at something and think <i>they want us to do what?</i> 
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Then, when I understand what's being asked of me, I think <i> oh, that's no problem</i> and <i>I got this</i>.
						</p> 
						
						<p>
							So far, I've started tasks right away, but invariably my confidence slowly wanes.
						</p> 
						
						<p> 
							And though I resist, I hit bottom, and decide that I probably need to do more research than less, committing to an hour or three I hadn't planned on.
						</p>
						
						<p> 
							But hey, in the end, the task becomes completely manageable and I'm proud of the finished product. Hopefully as prep continues the amplitudes of these emotions shrink, until things feel natural!
