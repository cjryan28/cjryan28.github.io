					<h1> Values </h1>
					<div id= "body">
						<span id= "date"><i>June 22, 2014</i> </span>
						<h3> Creativity </h3>
						<p> 
							Humans make hundreds of decisions each day- some are tiny and some are big. A lot of the time I get caught up in making sure I make the right big decisions, and sometimes I'm lazy about small decisions. My bad behavior matters because each decision, regardless of the size, affects. Sometimes I think of decision making as a tree. Making one decision will lead me down a branch with future decisions different than the other decision's branch. My excuse for focusing on big decisions more than small decisions is because those branches are more visible. Trying to understand what my life would be like if I take one job over the other is easier than understanding what is going to happen if I choose to make my bed or not. And while the big decision branches may be important to the structural integrity of the tree, the tree is energized because of it's leaves. These leaves sprout from the smallest branches, the small decisions.  
						</p>
						<p>
							I don't know how exactly how clear my extended metaphor was, but the bottom line is that I feel most alive- happiest, proudest, or most satisfied- when I make small decisions that help me live fuller. 
						</p>
						<p>
							This is where creativity becomes important. Small decisions seem so insignificant that I feel like it takes creativity to bring to fruition the small decisions' affects. When small decision making is creative, it becomes concious and then tangible. Creative small decision making is inherently sincere, because it has been thought up in my own mind. Small decisions like buying flowers for my mom, holding the door open for an elderly person, or writing a handwritten note to extended family make me feel alive- happy, proud, and satisfied to be connected to who I am in the way that I am. I think this is why creativity is something I value so much. When I make good small decisions creatively, I'm not only positively affecting others around me, but I'm also expressing myself. In a way others hear you when you show them your small decisions. And while it's easy to show something negative from a seemingly inconsequential small decision, creativity can help to shape the negative into something more positive.
						</p>
						<p>  
							Of course I feel happy, proud, and satisfied when I hit a major branch in my life: getting a scholarship, graduating college, accepting a job offer or finishing professional exams. But that type of happiness, pride, and satisfaction is more hollow. I think it's because they are brought about by hard-work and will be brought about by hard-work again in the future. 
						</p>	
						<h3> Measurement </h3>
						<p>  
							I try to live creatively, but there's room for improvement. I think I can be more mindful of my creativity. Sometimes I feel like I'm too quick to react or I narrow my thoughts when I feel negatively. I know that these pressured situations are some of the best opportunities I have to act creatively. It's a journey, right. I'll score myself at 4.
						</p>	
						<h3> Advice </h3>
						<p>  
							I don't think there's much anything worse than unsolicited advice. I'm very careful to dole it out, especially if I feel like it's something important a person is dealing with. When I give advice, I try to make it as balanced as possible and make sure I don't use the second person. I was the pledge trainer for my business fraternity about a year ago. A lot of the pledges were freshman or sophomore, and I made it clear to them that I will always be available to run things by or to get a second opinion since I had recently been through similar experiences. I got an email earlier this summer asking me about my opinion on very different professional careers and my advice on which I think is the better choice. I provided him my opinion and urged him to continue researching. 
						</p>
						<h3> Stereotype Threat </h3>
						<p>  
							When I think about my values, I think about how and why I'm living. I think about what makes me me. It was tough to explain one of my values, which makes me think that I'm not completely aware or comfortable with them. Similarly, I may not be the most aware of or comfortable with stereotype threat when it happens.   
						</p>
						<p>  
							I think a more important note to realize is if I looked at that list and found a value that makes me me, others have looked at the same list and found values that make them them. For all I know, we may share very similar core set of values. Even if we don't share a core set of values, values are something everyone has. When I deal with stereotype threat, I think it will be important to remember that any antagonizer or victim is a person with values, just like me. At the core, we all believe in something, and we are all human.

						<h3> Takeaways </h3>
						<p> 
							Learning about stereotype threats this week was interesting. At first I thought that stereotype threat was some form of racially motivated self fufilling prophecy. I imagined that it would be easy to have self-doubt and low self esteem when your identity is in the minority. Soon though, I found that stereotype threat is something different completely. It's a predisposition to underperformance, a reality of how someone may act based soley upon how they expect they will be perceived. My initial reaction was that this is crazy. People must be able to become more than what they think society thinks of them. Then I thought more on it and realized that of course people can become more than what they think society thinks of them, but it's significantly harder for those people. 
						</p>
						<p>
							I've been thinking hard on trying to relate with stereotype threats. I haven't often felt or acted strongly because of my identity. Here's the best I could come up with. In college, I was a part of two fraternities, a social one and a business one. And I think it's fair to say that a solid part of my identity was formed by being heavily involved in these two groups. Since I had friends in each group that knew I belonged to the other, I think I perceived that they expected me to act differently I acted slightly different in the two groups. I was more social hanging out with my business fraternity friends and I was more serious hanging out with my fraternity friends. I was attune to this for the last half of college and would try to make my behavior consistent, but I think the difference is attributable to stereotype threat.   
						</p>
						<p>  
							When a white male is told that he will be taking an assessment that Asians normally perform better on, he performs worse. In college maybe I felt that my business friends thought my social friends were more outgoing so I acted more outgoing. Meanwhile, my fraternity friends thought my business friends were more serious, so I acted more serious. I think my relation to stereotype threat is valid, which helps me understand the idea. Luckily, my experience with stereotype threat hasn't negatively impacted my performance, goals, or future. I can imagine how difficult and helpless it may be, however, to be in a situation where stereotype threat is real and has negative implications. 
						</p>	
						<p>
							What I take away from all of this is the importance of community and trust. When people feel comfortable around other people, they are free to realize their true potential, whithout any psychologically ingrained limitations. I will try my best to be more mindful of how I may make others feel.

					<h1> Peer Programming </h1>
					<div id= "body">
						<span id= "date"><i>June 15, 2014</i> </span>
						<h3> A lot to manage </h3>
						<p> 
							Peer pairing is not a simple task. Solving difficult problems with someone you've just met on platforms new to the pair takes focus. The setup requires active participation, listening, and thinking. It's easy to get distracted, moving challenges in the wrong direction, moving challenges in a different direction than my pair, or moving nowhere with challenges. It's good to be concious of how I'm experiencing a challenge so that I can communicate clearly and concisely. Sometimes, though, it's too late, and I act overwhelmed, frustrated, or bossy before I realize it's how I'm feeling. 
						</p>
						<p>
							I think the one emotion most notable that arises is low confidence. I've paired with about 10 different people, all of whom have varying skill levels and knowledge. I think when I approach a challenge, after meeting my pair- normally for the first time- I'll try to gauge who has more experience on a subject. I'm quick to play down how much I understand or know, because I like to feel very comfortable with material before I tell other's I know it. Most of the time, I assess the situation OK and we drive and naviagate in a beneficial manner to both of us. However, when I end up being the more experience pair but my assessment led me to drive, the session becomes more awkward, frustrating, and less efficient. If I'm navigating, but I end up being the less experienced pair, the session is a blow to my confidence. I think it's more important for me to learn to be fluid with transitions from one pairing responsibility to the next, or at least become more comfortable with voicing my feelings.
						</p>
						<h3> K.A.S. </h3>
						<p>  
							DBC's feedback system is really great. I'd venture to say it's one of the best developed systems in the program, and I appreciate it a lot. Kind, actionable, and specific feedback normally involves some kind of comprehensive recap of the pairing session. My feedback- which has scored OK- starts with why my I benefitted from having paired with whomever during the session. Then it explains what I think would have made the session better. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Often when I write feedback, I feel there is a tradeoff between being actionable and kind. When I want to be direct, I can come across as blunt or crude. When I am too kind, my feedback loses value, because it becomes too vague as to not hurt my pairs feelings. Luckily, DBC requires feedback also be specific, which I have found to help turn actionable feedback into kind feedback too. Specific feedback helps me do this, because specific feedback explains reasons for you to have actionable feedback. When feedback is specific, it can be seen as rational and more eye-opening and less opinionated. 
						</p>
						<h3> Meta emotions </h3>
						<p>  
							With peer pairing and feedback, I remind myself that if something isn't perfect, it doesn't mean it's wrong or that I'm not trying my hardest. Sometimes I confuse criticism with failure, and I'm working on reseting the way I think about that. Room for improvements or weaknesses are good, because they can be things I work on and progress towards. Criticism is great cause it can draw attention to things I need to work on, but it also makes me feel vulnerable. It's amazing that feedback can put a smile or make me feel like I've got a lot of work to do. I think it's good that I'm aware of how it affects me. And while I want to take feedback seriously and notice trends in the feedback I recieve, I also want to realize that it's meant in only the most supportive way.

					<h1> Privacy & Security </h1>
					<div id= "body">
						<span id= "date"><i>June 8, 2014</i> </span>
						<h3> Tech Industry Issues </h3>
						<p> 
							I think tech companies have to think a lot about privacy. 
						</p> 
						
						<p> 
							Common technology, until recently, hadn't the capability to impact privacy. Today's society's privacy is challenged by location based services, information shared on the internet, and surveillance. Historically speaking, human lives have been more private than not, with each human deciding the information he or she wants to share and with whom he or she wants to share it. Nowadays, people, corporations, and countries have the capability to search for public information and find information some may have thought to be private. Today, tech companies are at the forefront of asking the question: is privacy a need, and if it is, how much do humans need? Tech companies are asking these questions, because they are incentivized to compromise privacy and sell personal information. 
						</p>
						
						<p> 
							Save the human need for it, privacy is an issue worth exploring, because sometimes a lack of privacy engenders security concerns. When information is made public, it can be used in a way that harms others. Deciding what information harms others is another tricky issue facing the tech industry and tech heavy organizations. This issue was most notably demonstrated by Edward Snowden and his National Security Agency document leaks. 
						</p>

						<p>
							These big questions surround an issue on which most everyone has an opinion. To explore privacy further, I have posted three relevant TED talks. The first is Edward Snowden explaining what he did and why he did it. The second is a NSA spokesperson sharing the NSA's point of view on Snowden's actions. The last talk is lighter, but equally important. In the last video, Twitter's Del Harvey explains how she accomplishes her job keeping Twitter a safe place.

					<h1> Thinking Style </h1>
					<div id= "body">
						<span id= "date"><i>June 1, 2014</i> </span>
						<h3> Thinking Style </h3>
						<p> 
							My thinking style is Abstract Sequential. 
						</p> 
						
						<p> 
							The website says that Abstract Sequential thinkers enjoy the world of theory. I feel that's pretty faithful to the way I picture my thinking style. I know that I like to read  lot of resources until I understand something. I also know I don't like to continue with something until I feel like I know exactly what's going on. I'm big with asking why.
						</p>
						
						<p> 
							So far DBC's teaching style has been manageable. With my thinking style, I normally like to take time and process information. It's nice that DBC's efficient with their teaching, posting links to resources DBC feels will most quickly and clearly explain things. Normally, I feel I can comprehend what's happening. I do have issues sometimes, and that's when my thinking style imipeads more than it helps. When I don't understand what's happening, I can take some time exploring and reading myself. This is especially counter productive when the things I am researching are topics DBC is planning to teach on later in the curriculum. 
						</p>
						
						<p> 
							I think my thinking style assimilates well with a growth mindset. I always feel that I can improve my knowledge and keep a list of topics in a notebook that I remind myself to look over again so that I can really solidify my understanding. 
						</p>

						<h3> DBC Reaction </h3>
						<p> 
							I'm going to try to be mindful here and see what happens. 
						</p> 
						
						<p> 
							Overall, I'm generally unsure. I'm unsure of the time commitment, the financial commitment, the teachers, the other students, and whether I should disable Google community notifications to my email. I'm glad Shereef explained his restaurant or kitchen analogy, from which I gathered if I continue to evaluate whether or not DBC is worth it, I'll have missed opportunities to make it worth it. Continuing, I liked that admitted DBC is an experiment. It makes me feel less unsure knowing we're all experimenting
						</p>
						
						<p> 
							Then, I have other feelings about DBC's teaching approach. These feelings are positive. I feel cool cloning repositories and having resources all around me. It's already clear that I have a support system that wants me to do my best. And I'm all for it! 
						</p>
						<p> 
							I think my residual feelings concern my learning approach. When I have a task to complete, I want to do it efficiently, completely, and correctly. 
						</p>
						
						<p>
							First I look at something and think <i>they want us to do what?</i> 
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Then, when I understand what's being asked of me, I think <i> oh, that's no problem</i> and <i>I got this</i>.
						</p> 
						
						<p>
							So far, I've started tasks right away, but invariably my confidence slowly wanes.
						</p> 
						
						<p> 
							And though I resist, I hit bottom, and decide that I probably need to do more research than less, committing to an hour or three I hadn't planned on.
						</p>
						
						<p> 
							But hey, in the end, the task becomes completely manageable and I'm proud of the finished product. Hopefully as prep continues the amplitudes of these emotions shrink, until things feel natural!
