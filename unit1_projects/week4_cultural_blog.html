			<h3> Tech Industry Issues </h3>
				<p> I think tech companies have to think a lot about privacy. </p> 
				
				<p> I don't want to call privacy a problem, but it's definitely an issue facing the tech industry. Common technology, until recently, hadn't the capability to impact privacy. Today's society's privacy is challenged by location based services, information shared on the internet, and surveillance. Historically speaking, human lives have been more private than not, with each human deciding the information he or she wants to share and with whom he or she wants to share it. Nowadays, people, corporations, and countries have the capability to search for public information and find information some may have thought to be private. Today, tech companies are at the forefront of asking the question: is privacy a need, and if it is, how much do humans need? Tech companies are asking these questions, because they are incentivized to compromise privacy and sell personal information. </p>
				
				<p> Save the human need for it, privacy is an issue worth exploring, because sometimes a lack of privacy engenders security concerns. When information is made public, it can be used in a way that harms others. Deciding what information harms others is another tricky issue facing the tech industry and tech heavy organizations. This issue was most notably demonstrated by Edward Snowden and his National Security Agency document leaks. </p>

				<p>These big questions surround an issue on which most everyone has an opinion. To explore privacy further, I have posted three relevant TED talks. The first is Edward Snowden explaining what he did and why he did it. The second is a NSA spokesperson sharing the NSA's point of view on Snowden's actions. The last talk is lighter, but equally important. In the last video, Twitter's Del Harvey explains how she accomplishes her job keeping Twitter a safe place. </p>
