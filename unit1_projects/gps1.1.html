                <p> 
                    Pair programming is a method of writing code where two people
                    work on one project at the same time. Pair programming can take
                    a few forms. The common ways to pair program are: driver/navigator
                    and ping pong. Driver/navigator paring involves the navigator explaining
                    what needs to be done, while the driver writes the code. In ping pong
                    pairing, each of the pairs take turns on writing the code. Driver/navigator
                    is most commonly used when one of the pair has a greater expertise.

                <h3> <i>Why</i> Do Pair Programming? </h3>
                <p> Pair programming divides the labor of coding into two parts,
                which allows greater focus on each. The driver gets to focus on 
                getting the code written effectively and accurately, while the navigator
                 can analyze the direction of the project and copy-edit the syntax
                 without having to split their attention with writing. By bringing two
                 different skill sets and knowledge bases to bear on the same problem,
                 each person helps mitigate the gaps in the other's experience and
                  broadens the number of "tricks" available to the programmers.

                <h3> <i>How</i> Do You Pair Program? </h3>
                <p> 
                    To be successful at pair programming, the most important quality for 
                    the pair to share is communication. It is essential that the pair discuss
                    their plan, how to execute their plan, and any misconceptions along the way
                    regarding the execution. Pair programming is a great way to learn, but
                    only if the pairs make the most of it. It's important for each of the pairs
                    to ask questions so that they can learn along the way.

                <h3>Pair Programming at Dev Bootcamp</h3>
                
                <p>Dev Bootcamp brings together people with different 
                    skillsets and asks them to learn very quickly. 
                    The sharing of knowledge that is fundamental to 
                    pair programming accelerates that learning organically.
                    Also, DBC puts enormous focus on developing empathy and 
                    teamwork in coding situations: pair programming is both a
                     model and an experimental lab for those people skills.

                <h3> Casey's Feedback </h3>
                <p> Pairing with Alex was a good introduction to pairing. We
                    probably spent a little too much time in the beginning discussing
                    the technicalities of pairing, but I imagine that was because
                    it was both of our first times pairing. I was happy that the assignment
                    was something that we were qualified to accomplish. It was nice
                    talking about our process and implementing the website together, because
                    I felt we were on the same page most of the time. Since the task wasn't too difficult
                    we could separate the work well and make sure we were efficient as well as 
                    effective. I think I learned that I'm talkative when I pair, so I 
                    should make sure that I ask my pair if I'm being too talkative. To be honest,
                    my favorite part of this pairing was learning more about Alex, really neat and 
                    interesting stuff!

                <h3>Alex's Feedback</h3>
                <p>I really enjoyed working with Casey. We communicated well, 
                with a structured but fluid understanding of our roles at 
                a given time, and we had a pretty similar level of experience. 
                The vibe was really positive and genuinely collaborative, and 
                Casey knew some HTML5 tricks that really simplified our CSS.
                The challenge itself was pretty simple, which gave us space
                to figure out what worked for each of us in Stypi. I was afraid
                at first that I was taking the reins too much, but Casey was
                really good about keeping the lines of communication flowing,
                which made it easy to keep things on equal footing. He seems
                like just a solid guy.
