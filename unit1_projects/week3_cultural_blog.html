			<h3> Thinking Style </h3>
				<p> My thinking style is Abstract Sequential. </p> 
				
				<p> The website says that Abstract Sequential thinkers enjoy the world of theory. I feel that's pretty faithful to the way I picture my thinking style. I know that I like to read  lot of resources until I understand something. I also know I don't like to continue with something until I feel like I know exactly what's going on. I'm big with asking why.</p>
				
				<p> So far DBC's teaching style has been manageable. With my thinking style, I normally like to take time and process information. It's nice that DBC's efficient with their teaching, posting links to resources DBC feels will most quickly and clearly explain things. Normally, I feel I can comprehend what's happening. I do have issues sometimes, and that's when my thinking style imipeads more than it helps. When I don't understand what's happening, I can take some time exploring and reading myself. This is especially counter productive when the things I am researching are topics DBC is planning to teach on later in the curriculum. </p>
				
				<p> I think my thinking style assimilates well with a growth mindset. I always feel that I can improve my knowledge and keep a list of topics in a notebook that I remind myself to look over again so that I can really solidify my understanding. </p>
