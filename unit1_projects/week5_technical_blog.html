			<h2> Classes </h2>
				<h3> When, why, how </h3>
				<p> 
					Classes are the way Ruby does objects. Classes have variables and methods that execute on behalf of the object. Classes are used when a programmer wants to store, manipulate, or return date belonging to some particular object. Objects can be people, shopping carts, maps, or anything that can be defined with variables. For example, if I created a class of people, they could have variables like birthday, social security number, and name. These people could have methods like celebrate birthday or change name. The key to classes is that they use variables to store data that's manipulated with methods and returned as new data to store or overwrite the old stored data.  
				</p>
				<h3> Object oriented </h3>
				<p>
					Class variables come in different types. The most common relating to a specific class is called an instance variable. Instance variables are unique to a particular class object. Many objects relating to that class can be created, but they each have different instance variables. Instance variables are normally information passed in when a new object is created.
				</p>
				<p>
					chad = Person.new("Chad", 17, "May 15, 1994")
				</p>
				<p>
					Above I created a new object chad of the class Person. The object chad now has three instance variables defining him: his name, age, and birthdate. While this code creates chad the object, first there has to be code that defines the class Person.
				</p>
				<p>
					class Person
				<br>def initialize(name, age, birthdate)
				<br>@name = name
				<br>@age = age
				<br>@birthdate = birthdate
				<br>end
				<br>end
				</p>
				<p>
					What happens now is that class Person is created. Person.new references the initialize method. Notice that the three things defining chad- parameters- match the three parameters in the initialize function. This matches so that the information passed in can be stored as instance variables, the variables with the @ sign. Instance variables are needed, because then these variables can be used throughout the class, with other methods.
				</p>
					def getTimeToTwentyFirst
				<br>puts 21 - @age
				<br>end						
				<p>  
					The class could include a method like the one above that would return the number of years before a person turns 21. Notice how the @age variable can be used even though the method getTimeToTwentyFirst requires no parameters. So when 
				</p>
				<p>
					chad.getTimeToTwentyFirst
				</p>
				<p>
					is entered into the console, the time until chad turns 21 will be printed on a new line.
