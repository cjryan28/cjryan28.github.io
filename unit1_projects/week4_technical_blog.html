			<h2> Enumerable.map </h2>
				<h3> What's It Used For? </h3>
				<p> 
					The map function can be used on arrays and hashes. 
					Ruby.org explains that the function returns a new array with the results of running block once for every element in enum. It continues saying that if no block is given, an enumerator is returned instead. I find a lot of Ruby.org to be a foreign language to me, so I'll try connect its explanation with some examples.
				</p>
				<p>
					Example 1: [2, 2, 3, 4].map {|i| i * 2 } ==> [4, 4, 6, 8]
				</p>
				<p>
					Here's how I understand what's happening. For each i in the array, its value will be multiplied by 2 and outputted in a different array. However, if the map! function was called, the new values would be outputted in the same array, overwriting the original one.
				</p>
				<p>
					The same basic thing happens in hashes, except the block statement, what's inside curly braces, must be changed to reflect what should be mapped. And, it should be noted that map function outputs an array, even when called on a hash.
				</p>
				<p>
					Example 2: {"a"=> 3, "b"=> 2}.map {|k, v| v * 2} ==> [6, 4]
				</p>
				<p>
					Example 3: {"a"=> 3, "b"=> 2}.map {|k, v| k * 2} ==> ["aa", "bb"]
				</p>
				
				<h3> What's Its Limitations? </h3>
				<p>  
					The map function returns an array, so the map! function can't be used on hashes. This means that the map function can't directly affect hashes on its own. It must be used in conjunction with other functions to alter the contents of the hash.
