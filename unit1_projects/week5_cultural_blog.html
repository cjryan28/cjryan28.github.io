			<h2> Peer Pairing </h2>
				<h3> A lot to manage </h3>
				<p> 
					Peer pairing is not a simple task. Solving difficult problems with someone you've just met on platforms new to the pair takes focus. The setup requires active participation, listening, and thinking. It's easy to get distracted, moving challenges in the wrong direction, moving challenges in a different direction than my pair, or moving nowhere with challenges. It's good to be concious of how I'm experiencing a challenge so that I can communicate clearly and concisely. Sometimes, though, it's too late, and I act overwhelmed, frustrated, or bossy before I realize it's how I'm feeling. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I think the one emotion most notable that arises is low confidence. I've paired with about 10 different people, all of whom have varying skill levels and knowledge. I think when I approach a challenge, after meeting my pair- normally for the first time- I'll try to gauge who has more experience on a subject. I'm quick to play down how much I understand or know, because I like to feel very comfortable with material before I tell other's I know it. Most of the time, I assess the situation OK and we drive and naviagate in a beneficial manner to both of us. However, when I end up being the more experience pair but my assessment led me to drive, the session becomes more awkward, frustrating, and less efficient. If I'm navigating, but I end up being the less experienced pair, the session is a blow to my confidence. I think it's more important for me to learn to be fluid with transitions from one pairing responsibility to the next, or at least become more comfortable with voicing my feelings.
				</p>
				<h3> K.A.S. </h3>
				<p>  
					DBC's feedback system is really great. I'd venture to say it's one of the best developed systems in the program, and I appreciate it a lot. Kind, actionable, and specific feedback normally involves some kind of comprehensive recap of the pairing session. My feedback- which has scored OK- starts with why my I benefitted from having paired with whomever during the session. Then it explains what I think would have made the session better. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Often when I write feedback, I feel there is a tradeoff between being actionable and kind. When I want to be direct, I can come across as blunt or crude. When I am too kind, my feedback loses value, because it becomes too vague as to not hurt my pairs feelings. Luckily, DBC requires feedback also be specific, which I have found to help turn actionable feedback into kind feedback too. Specific feedback helps me do this, because specific feedback explains reasons for you to have actionable feedback. When feedback is specific, it can be seen as rational and more eye-opening and less opinionated. 
				</p>
				<h3> Meta emotions </h3>
				<p>  
					With peer pairing and feedback, I remind myself that if something isn't perfect, it doesn't mean it's wrong or that I'm not trying my hardest. Sometimes I confuse criticism with failure, and I'm working on reseting the way I think about that. Room for improvements or weaknesses are good, because they can be things I work on and progress towards. Criticism is great cause it can draw attention to things I need to work on, but it also makes me feel vulnerable. It's amazing that feedback can put a smile or make me feel like I've got a lot of work to do. I think it's good that I'm aware of how it affects me. And while I want to take feedback seriously and notice trends in the feedback I recieve, I also want to realize that it's meant in only the most supportive way.
