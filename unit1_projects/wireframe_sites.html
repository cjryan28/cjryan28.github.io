	<h1> Instagram </h1>

	<p> The wireframe screenshot is of my Instagram homepage. The webpage wants to display as many photos as possible. Instagram faces a visual challenge, because users can have an unlimited amount of photos attached to their profile. To mitigate the problem, Instagram includes a photo collage at the top of their site.</p>
	<h1> YouTube </h1>

	<p> The wireframe screenshot is of my YouTube homepage. Visually, YouTube tries to introduce you to videos you would like to watch. However, YouTube has also been trying to monetize their site. I'd guess most users access YouTube through shared links that take the user directly to the content. Most likely the smaller group of YouTube users that access their homepage are there to browse. YouTube takes advantage of their aimless nature by including the sites biggest advertisement beneath your navigation bar. After that YouTube tries to pepper you with videos it thinks you may be interested in. </p>
	<h1> Etsy </h1>
	<img src="images/etsy_wireframe.jpg">
	<p> The wireframe screenshot is of my Etsy homepage. The webpage faces a lot of challenges. It wants to be social, connect you with items you may want to purchase, and let you browse the vast category of items simply. To accomplish their goals, Etsy makes the navigation bar directed towards social aspects, the sidebar for exploring varying categories of items, and the main section content for items it thinks you may like to see. </p>
