			<h2> JavaScript </h2>
				<h3> What's It Used For? </h3>
				<p> 
					An about.com article described it best in a general way. The article explains that a good website uses three programming languages. It uses HTML for the content, CSS for the appearance, and JavaScript for basic interations. The article adds that JavaScript changes websites from static to dynamic. With HTML, users would need to submit forms that would be sent to the server, which would reload the webpage. However, with JavaScript, users are able to interact with the website without contacting the server. This makes JavaScript dynamic. Even better, JavaScript compiles on the user's side, so it doesn't take up unecessary bandwith. This feature of the programming language makes it predominantly client-side language.
				</p>
				<h3> Why's It Popular? </h3>
				<p>  
					JavaScript has multiple functionalities ranging from spell check while a person is typing on a webpage to animations visible on the webpage. This article explains the 50 best uses of JavaScript on the web, http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/freebies/examples-html5-javascript-uses. After some research, I've gathered a list of advantages to JavaScript. The language may be popular because of these features: client side execution, easy syntax language similar to Java, fast to process on the user's end, and there is extended functionality to webpages with third party add ons.
				</p>
				<h3> What's Its Limitations? </h3>
				<p>  
					JavaScript is a limited language. It's not to be used for large projects that could stress a user's computer. The language introduces security issues because the language is executed on the client's side, granting potential access to a user's system. Finally, some JavaScript renderings vary, which can cause major headaches for implementation.
