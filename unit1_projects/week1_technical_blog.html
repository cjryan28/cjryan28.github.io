			<h3> Instagram </h3>
				<p> Instagram is my favorite website. To be candid, I visit the website relatively infrequently compared to the time I spend on the mobile application. The website and the mobile application share common features, though. The website's purpose is to showcase users photography in a way that flatters the user and keeps the user's followers updated. Instagram accomplishes its purpose in an outrageously simple format, which is why I am a big fan. It's minimalist structure appeals to me. I would argue it changes its users' behaviors too. It seems to me that most of the people I follow on Instagram try to make meaningful, serious posts on the social media. Facebook appears a social media dump when compared to Instagram.<br><br>Instagram's homepage is a simple scroll, and it's navigation bar includes few options. The photos are displayed large enough that they consume the entire window, ensuring that one photo takes the user's complete attention. Instagram's users can view their photos in an electronic collage at the top of their homepage. Its users can see their photos displayed on top in collage, while the pictures are also displayed statically beneath. <br><br>The website is practical, artistic, minimalist, and efficient. It's brilliant.</p>
			<h3> YouTube </h3>
				<p> YouTube is my second favorite website. On YouTube, users can learn, explore, get inspired, and laugh. The website understands its multifunctionality and organizes itself appropriately. On the homepage, YouTube users see different sections like Popular Worldwide, Recommended for You, Music, and Comedy. If the homepage doesn't seem customized enough, a user can search using a search tool in the navigation or look at more general YouTube videos. While YouTube is social in its likes and comments, the general user doesn't need to be social to enjoy the website. <br><br> It's safe to say that without YouTube, the learning curve for making this website would've been very steep. Thanks, YouTube!

			<h3> Etsy </h3>
				<p> Etsy is a website I have recently come to love. The website attempts to connect interested buyers with small scale producers marketing products in a social way. The idea is fantastic. By taking advantage of the internet, many small producers now have the real estate and reach they need to be successful. While a local scented beard oil producer lives a financially dangerous lifestyle at best, the same producer on Etsy could find demand all over the world. Continuing, the platform gives people the freedom to provide value to others in any way they can. And while the mug makers on Etsy seem a bit saturated, I normally can't wait to explore anything else. Since its prodcuts range from t-shirts to record players, Etsy is designed chaotically. It's tough to find something that someone has never found or liked before. I think it still has potential. Maybe it should have a weekly showcase of undiscovered talent! </p>
