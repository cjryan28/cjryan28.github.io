			<h3> Instagram </h3>
				<p> Instagram is my favorite website. To be candid, I visit the website relatively infrequently compared to the time I spend on the mobile application. The website and the mobile application share common features, though. The website's purpose is to showcase users photography in a way that flatters the user and keeps the user's followers updated. Instagram accomplishes its purpose in an outrageously simple format, which is why I am a big fan. It's minimalist structure appeals to me. I would argue it changes its users' behaviors too. It seems to me that most of the people I follow on Instagram try to make meaningful, serious posts on the social media. Facebook appears a social media dump when compared to Instagram.<br><br>Instagram's homepage is a simple scroll, and it's navigation bar includes few options. The photos are displayed large enough that they consume the entire window, ensuring that one photo takes the user's complete attention. Instagram's users can view their photos in an electronic collage at the top of their homepage. Its users can see their photos displayed on top in collage, while the pictures are also displayed statically beneath. <br><br>The website is practical, artistic, minimalist, and efficient. It's brilliant.</p>
			<h3> YouTube </h3>
				<p> YouTube is my second favorite website.  
				</p>
			<h3> Etsy </h3>
				<p> Etsy is a website I have recently come to love. </p>
