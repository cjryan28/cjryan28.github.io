			<h3> DBC Reaction </h3>
				<p> I'm going to try to be mindful here and see what happens. </p> 
				
				<p> Overall, I'm generally unsure. I'm unsure of the time commitment, the financial commitment, the teachers, the other students, and whether I should disable Google community notifications to my email. I'm glad Shereef explained his restaurant or kitchen analogy, from which I gathered if I continue to evaluate whether or not DBC is worth it, I'll have missed opportunities to make it worth it. Continuing, I liked that admitted DBC is an experiment. It makes me feel less unsure knowing we're all experimenting</p>
				
				<p> Then, I have other feelings about DBC's teaching approach. These feelings are positive. I feel cool cloning repositories and having resources all around me. It's already clear that I have a support system that wants me to do my best. And I'm all for it! </p>
				<p> I think my residual feelings concern my learning approach. When I have a task to complete, I want to do it efficiently, completely, and correctly. </p>
				
				<p>First I look at something and think <i>they want us to do what?</i> </p>
				
				<p>Then, when I understand what's being asked of me, I think <i> oh, that's no problem</i> and <i>I got this</i>.</p> 
				
				<p>So far, I've started tasks right away, but invariably my confidence slowly wanes.</p> 
				
				<p> And though I resist, I hit bottom, and decide that I probably need to do more research than less, committing to an hour or three I hadn't planned on.</p>
				
				<p> But hey, in the end, the task becomes completely manageable and I'm proud of the finished product. Hopefully as prep continues the amplitudes of these emotions grow smaller and smaller, until things feel natural!</p>
