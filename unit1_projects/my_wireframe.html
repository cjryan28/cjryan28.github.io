		I want to leverage the normal HTML5 structure to create my webpage. It will be organized into a header, navigation beneath the header, aside, section and footer. Besides the aside and section, all elements will take the entire width of the page. The aside and section will be split into 25% and 70% of the page. I'll reassess the margins after I get the site up. The aside will include a picture of me, my name, and links to my other sites. The section page will include elements that discuss general ideas. Paragraphs will be blocked to take 60% of the section, while quotes, images, and other resources will be blocked to take 27.5% of the page.
