			<h2> CSS Concepts </h2>
				<h3> Display Inline vs. Inline Blocks </h3>
				<p> 
					HTML elements are displayed in varying ways. The variations are block, inline, or none. The most common element displayed as a block is a paragraph. As a block element, paragraphs start their formmation on a new line than the normal HTML flow, and they take the full width available to them. The most common inline element is the anchor element, the a used for links. As an inline element, these items will appear next to whatever has been coded before it.
					To demonstrate, here are two paragraph and two anchors.
				</p>
				<br></br>
				<p>  
					Paragraph 1 
				</p>
				<p>  
					Paragraph 2 
				</p>
				<br></br>
				<a href="#">Anchor 1</a>
				<a href="#">Anchor 2</a>
				<br></br>
				<p>
					CSS lets us change the default display. With CSS, we can set anchors to display as blocks, which will move one link beneath the other, and paragraphs to display inline, which will concatenate the paragraphs.
				</p>
				<h3> Inline Block </h3>
				<p>
					Moving forward, there's a display property called inline-block. Confusingly titled, it's easiest for me to think of it seperately than display inline or block. I like to think of inline-block as an alternative to float. Display inline-block treats each paragraph as a block, but will display them inline. There are a few things to know about this though. By default paragraphs are displayed at eachother's baseline as shown in Image 1.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fortunately, using the vertical-align property allows the user to change the vertical alignment. For example you could change the alignment to top, which would mimic the way block elements look using the float property.
				</p>	
				<p>
					It's interesting to note that images are also inline elements. Only because the images to the right are formatted to take up 100% of the width, do the elements get forced into a stacked position.
